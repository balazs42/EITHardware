A modular ESP32-based project for measuring impedance between pairs of electrodes using dual ADS1261 ADCs, an external MUX36S16 multiplexer pair for channel routing, and the ESP32â€™s internal DAC for AC excitation generation. The system supports up to 16 electrodes with configurable excitation frequency, sampling rate, PGA gain, and digital filter via a serial command interface.
